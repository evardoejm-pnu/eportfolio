        <h2>💡 Beyond the Book: The Power of Reflective Teaching</h2>
        <hr style="border-color: var(--mustard-yellow);">

        <p>What an insightful session we had on **October 8, 2025**, with **Dr. Eric Easton** for our webinar, **"CIVERaging on Service: Building Holistic and Learner-Centered Education through Reflective Teaching."** It was a powerful reminder that sometimes, the most effective teaching isn't about following a script—it's about stepping back and *really* thinking about our approach.</p>

        <p>One story Dr. Easton shared really hit home for me. It was about a **challenging student** that his colleagues had tried *everything* on. They used every behavior technique, classroom management strategy, and by-the-book method they could find to try and get this student to engage instead of being disruptive or dismissive. They were doing everything "right," but nothing worked. Zero success.</p>

        <p>Then, Dr. Easton decided to try something completely different. He didn't come at the student with more rules or confrontation. Instead, he **approached the problem sideways**. He looked for **creative ways** to teach and connect, finding **different opportunities** for that child to learn effectively. And guess what? He managed to turn the situation around!</p>

        <p>That whole experience highlights the absolute **power of reflective teaching**. It's not about tossing out everything we've learned, but it’s a big nudge to remind us:</p>

        <blockquote>
            **You have to reflect on your methods, your manner, and your pedagogy.** We can't simply follow what's prescribed by "science" or the standard handbook and expect it to work for every single human being in our classroom. Teaching is a relationship, and sometimes, the solution isn't in the book—it's in the way we choose to *see* and *connect* with the learner.
        </blockquote>

        <p>It's a call to be more flexible, more human, and to trust our own informed judgment when the textbook approach fails.</p>
